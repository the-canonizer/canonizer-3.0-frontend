This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Cloning

```
- Clone repo
- Checkout to main branch
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
For windows Install git bash
```

```bash
- npm run dev: starts dev environment
- npm run build: creates a build
- npm run start: starts production environment
- npm run format: prettify all files
- npm run lint: checks eslint warnings and errors
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Environment
